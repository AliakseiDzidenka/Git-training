Sugar man
Won't ya hurry
Coz I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin
Won't ya bring back
All those colours to my dreams

Silver magic ships, you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man
Met a false friend
On a lonely, dusty road
Lost my heart
When I found it
It had turned to dead, black coal

Silver magic ships, you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man
You're the answer
That makes my questions disappear

Sugar man
Coz I'm weary
Of those double games I hear
Sugar man [x7]

Won't ya hurry
Coz I'm tired of these scenes

Won't ya bring back
All those colours to my dreams

Silver magic ships, you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane
