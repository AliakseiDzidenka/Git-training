Sugar man
Won't ya hurry
Coz I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin
Won't ya bring back
All those colours to my dreams

Silver magic ships, you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man
Met a false friend
On a lonely, dusty road
Lost my heart
When I found it
It had turned to dead, black coal

Silver magic ships, you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man
You're the answer
That makes my questions disappear
